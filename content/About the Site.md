[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a knowledge management app that lets you create, organize, and link Markdown notes in a local folder, effectively turning them into a personal knowledge base or "second brain."


I love using Obsidian for task management and its my main productivity tool. I treat it like my 2nd brain, a repository for any idea or notes I create, any fleeting thought my brain may come up with, any resource I find online, any video or piece of writing I find interesting. Its a repository of information inside my head, I do it all inside of Obsidian.

I thought it would cool to create an Obsidian esque portfolio site, with links to various topics and projects and parts of my life.

Heres a look at my obsidian setup ðŸ˜„
