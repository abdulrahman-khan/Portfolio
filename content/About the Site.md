## Obsidian: My Digital Second Brain

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is more than just a note-taking app—it's a powerful knowledge management system that transforms Markdown files into an interconnected web of thoughts, ideas, and insights.

### How Obsidian Changed My Workflow

Obsidian revolutionized how I capture, organize, and connect information. It's become my thought processing system: 

- **Fleeting Thoughts** → Quick captures that I can process later
- **Project Planning** → Breaking down complex work into manageable pieces
- **Learning Notes** → Connecting new concepts to existing knowledge
- **Resource Library** → Collecting interesting articles, videos, and tools
- **Daily Notes** -> Habit tracking stream-of-consciousness capture

## Quartz: Obsidian Notes Meet the Web

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) bridges the gap between private note-taking and public knowledge sharing. It's a static site generator specifically designed to transform your Obsidian vault into a beautiful, interactive website.
